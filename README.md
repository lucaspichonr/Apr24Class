My name is Lucas, I work on sales in the media tech industry and have been doing it for the last 7 years.
I have started 2 fintech projects by my own and have enjoyed getting to know the industry. I feel there's still lots of opportunities to drive innovation and am interested in further developing my skills in order to be able to make it easier for myself to identify them.
